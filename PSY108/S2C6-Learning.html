    {set:2, front:"Who conducted the Little Albert experiment?", back:"John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner."},
    {set:2, front:"What stimulus generalization occurred in Little Albert?", back:"Albert feared other similar white fluffy objects — rabbit, fur coat, Santa Claus beard."},
    {set:2, front:"How does counterconditioning differ from extinction?", back:"Extinction: CS without US (response fades). Counterconditioning: CS paired with new US to build incompatible response."},
    {set:2, front:"Why is taste aversion unique among classical conditioning examples?", back:"It can form after ONE pairing and survive even a long delay between CS and US (hours)."},

    {set:3, front:"What was Thorndike's puzzle box experiment?", back:"Cats learned to escape boxes through trial and error — successful behaviors were 'stamped in' (Law of Effect)."},
    {set:3, front:"What is behavior modification?", back:"Using learning principles (classical, operant, social learning) to purposely and systematically change behavior."},
    {set:3, front:"What is the difference between a primary and secondary reinforcer? Give an example.", back:"Primary = inherently satisfying (food). Secondary = learned value (money is just paper, but can buy food)."},

    // SET 4: SCHEDULES OF REINFORCEMENT (15)

    {set:4, front:"What is a fixed ratio (FR) schedule?", back:"Reinforcement after a FIXED NUMBER of responses. Produces high response rate with a pause after each reward."},
    {set:4, front:"What is a variable ratio (VR) schedule?", back:"Reinforcement after an UNPREDICTABLE number of responses. Produces highest response rate; most resistant to extinction."},
    {set:4, front:"What is a fixed interval (FI) schedule?", back:"Reinforcement for first response after a FIXED TIME period. Produces scallop pattern — burst of activity near deadline."},

    {set:4, front:"Which schedule is most resistant to extinction?", back:"Variable Ratio (VR) — you never know when the next reward comes, so you keep responding."},

    {set:4, front:"What is the 'scallop pattern' in fixed interval schedules?", back:"Low response rate after reinforcement, then increasing burst of activity just before the next scheduled reward."},
    {set:4, front:"Which schedule does a slot machine use?", back:"Variable Ratio — unpredictable number of pulls before winning."},
    {set:4, front:"Which schedule does a weekly paycheck follow?", back:"Fixed Interval — reinforcement (pay) after a fixed time period (one week)."},
    {set:4, front:"Which schedule does checking social media follow?", back:"Variable Interval — reinforcement (new posts/likes) comes after unpredictable time intervals."},
    {set:4, front:"Ratio vs. Interval schedules — what's the difference?", back:"Ratio = based on NUMBER of responses. Interval = based on TIME elapsed."},
    {set:4, front:"Fixed vs. Variable schedules — what's the key difference?", back:"Fixed = predictable (pausing after reward). Variable = unpredictable (no pausing, highest persistence)."},
    {set:4, front:"Why is variable ratio so resistant to extinction?", back:"Because the subject can never predict when the next reward will come — 'maybe THIS response will be the one!'"},
    {set:4, front:"What schedule is best for establishing a new behavior?", back:"Continuous reinforcement — rewards every response to build the behavior quickly."},

    // SET 5: OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING (15)

    {set:5, front:"What are Bandura's four conditions for observational learning?", back:"Attention, Retention, Reproduction, Motivation (ARRM)."},

    {set:5, front:"What is Reproduction in observational learning?", back:"Observer must be physically capable of performing the behavior."},
    {set:5, front:"What is Motivation in observational learning?", back:"Observer must want to perform the behavior; vicarious reinforcement can provide this."},

    {set:5, front:"What is vicarious reinforcement?", back:"Seeing someone else receive reinforcement for a behavior, which increases your own motivation to perform it."},
    {set:5, front:"What is vicarious punishment?", back:"Seeing someone else punished for a behavior, which decreases your motivation to imitate it."},
    {set:5, front:"What role does cognition play in observational learning?", back:"Critical role — attention and retention involve mental processes that Skinner's behaviorism ignored."},
    {set:5, front:"Example: You watch a coworker get promoted for staying late and start doing the same. What type of learning?", back:"Observational learning (modeling behavior seen in others, motivated by vicarious reinforcement)."},

    {set:6, front:"Positive Reinforcement vs. Negative Reinforcement: How are they alike?", back:"Both INCREASE behavior — that's what makes them both 'reinforcement.'"},
    {set:6, front:"Positive Punishment vs. Negative Punishment: How are they alike?", back:"Both DECREASE behavior — that's what makes them both 'punishment.'"},
